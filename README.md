Welcome to Tkinter Apps! This repository contains a collection of simple and intuitive desktop applications built using Python's Tkinter and ttkbootstrap libraries. These projects are perfect for anyone interested in learning about GUI (Graphical User Interface) development in Python. Whether you're a beginner or looking to brush up on your skills, these apps are a great starting point!
